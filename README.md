# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Modelling fluctuation phenomena in the plasma cortisol secretion system in normal man.**   
Lenbury Y, Pacheenburawana P. _Biosystems._ 1991;26(2):117-25.
[1668715](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1668715) ,  
**Abstract:**   
A system of three non-linear differential equations with exponential feedback
terms is proposed to model the self-regulating cortisol secretion system and
explain the fluctuation patterns observed in clinical data. It is shown that
the model exhibits bifurcation and chaos patterns for a certain range of
parametric values. This helps us to explain clinical observations and
characterize different dynamic behaviors of the self-regulative system.
